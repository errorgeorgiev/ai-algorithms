# Travelling Salesman Problem solver
The TSP is an optimization problem. It can be sovled by implementing genetic algorithm. These algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process that supports the evolution of life - natural selection. The algorithm is divided into five main phases which are:
1. Creating initial population
2. Calculating fitness
3. Selecting the best genes
4. Crossing over
5. Mutating to introduce variations

To run the program:
```
g++ TSP-genetic-algorithm
./a.out
```
Pass value N = number of cities and their coordinates will be automaticaly generated by the program.
